# SQATT
Repository that contains scripts that are useful when analyzing software quality.

It contains scripts to create profiles of specific quality aspects of a code base.
These scripts use the output of tools like 
<a href="https://scitools.com/">understand</a>, 
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">resharper</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc">cloc</a> etc to create the profiles.

The scripts can create profiles for:
* code size
* complexity
* coding rule violations
* fan-in and fan-out
* function size
* interface size
